## Dragging stuff in `Home.js`:
- Create a transparent dummy `<Draggable>` here and record draging axes from this `<Draggable>`.
- Then from the axes, manually displace the currentPressedPiece by calculations from the axes obtained from the dummy `<Draggable>`.
- This way, the `<Draggable>` acts as a controller
stick for the selected piece to move.
